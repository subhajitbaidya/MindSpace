## Benefits of Microservices, Service Oriented Architecture, Monorepo and Dependency Injection

- Loose coupling: Controllers donâ€™t care about how services or DB work.

- Testable: You can mock dependencies in services and controllers.

- Scalable: Easy to add more services/models/controllers via the DI container.

- Readable: Each layer has a clear responsibility.
