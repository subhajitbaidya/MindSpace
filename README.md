  Planning to use best practices of development for better handling of performance.
- **MERN Stack + Fast API + Langchain:** Services, Client, Database, Business logic and services in one place.
- **API:** Inter-communication between services using REST APIs and GraphQL.
- **Best Practices:** Readable code, using low level design concepts, documentation, and extensibility in mind.
